This website has been created as a technical assigment for acceptance to HackYourFuture coding school. This website was created using HTML and CSS.
Idea behind this webpage was to share my passion about animal well being and show advantages of animal adoption!

A few highlights of the webpage:
1. On top is navigation bar and on the side back to top button, to help users easily navigate the website.
2. On mouse hover images of cats are being increased.
3. The webpage is fully responsive and works on PC, tablets and smartphones.
4. In the page description you can also a find a link that leads to a animal rescue organization, from which the cats come from.
