                The Loes voor Dieren is a non-profit foundation that aims to promote
                animal welfare. This is being achieved by providing animals in need
                with a foster home, where they are cared until they find a permanent
                home. The foundation also aims to educate animal owners about proper
                animal care. <br />
                Only animals that are healthy are placed into new homes.

            <p>
                If you adopt a cat from Loes voor Dieren, we ask for a contribution
                towards the costs that we have incurred. The coordinators can tell you
                more about the amount.

        <h2 id="cat-care">How to care for your cat</h2>
        <div class="container-info">
            <p>
                The first day in a new house is strange. The animal may have no
                appetite or a little loose stool due to nervousness. If this happens,
                try to talk softly to your cat to calm it down. If the animal is
                clearly in distress, do not hesitate and go to the vet in consultation
                with the LOES Foundation.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you come home with your new family member, make sure the litter
                box is ready with a valerian drop in it. Allow the cat to explore the
                new environment. Some cats find a covered litter box scary. In this
                case, leave the cover of the box for a while until the animal gets
                used to it. On the first day place food near the litter box, so it can
                be easily found by the cat.
            </p>
            <p>
                Make sure you and the cat have time to get used to each other. Always
                have a scratching post and/or scratching board available so that your
                furniture is not destroyed. If necessary, you can use a few drops of
                valerian to encourage the cat to use the scratching post.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have other pets, make sure they ate before introducing the new
                housemate. Provide their own food bowls and if possible a separate
                litter box during the first period. If you give all animals a valerian
                drop between the shoulder blades, each animal smells the same and they
                can handle the situation better. If you have a dog, walk the dog while
                new cat is exploring the house. When a dog comes home from his walk,
                the newcomer is already there and has found a safe place.
            </p>
            <p>
                Do not let the animal out until it is used to you and the new
                environment, this can take up to 4-6 weeks. Go out with the animal the
                first few times and use a cat leash if necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
                A cat also needs exercise, especially indoor cats tend to become
                overweight. Provide your cats with various toys, don't forget the most
                beloved toy – laser pointer! Just be careful and do not shine it into
                your cat eyes.

                Snoopy was present to Ellen (foster mother for Loes voor Dieren) for
                her birthday. At that time Snoopy was only 10 weeks old and she
                quickly became good friends with the other two house cats Baloe and
                Caddy. Even though Ellen loves Charlies Brown`s dog Snoopy from
                Peanuts books, the Snoopy cat is actually not named after the dog. As
                a baby, she was as sweet as candy and constantly received the comment
                "oh what a candy!"(candy in Dutch is snoepje/snoepie).Now, Snoopy is
                the oldest cat in the house, she recently has celebrated her 15th
                birthday. She still is a very sweet cat, that demands alll the
                attention. Sadly, she really dislikes foster kittens since they also
                need a lot of care.

                5.5 years ago Ellen has decided to quit smoking. And that was not an
                easy task, so she needed a distraction. One day she saw extremely cute
                pictures of baby Banjer and thought that if she buys him, she is going
                to be too busy taking care of him to even think about smoking. Did
                this tactic work? Yes! Soon Banjer will be celebrating his 6th
                birthday and Ellen 6th anniversary of being smoke-free. Banjer being
                the oldest male cat in the house became the big brother of all the
                foster kittens. He may be a huge cat, but he is very soft and gentle
                with the little ones. His favourite things are licking people`s hands,
                trying to catch cat candies with his mouth and spending time with his
                girlfriend Lola.

                In 2015 the family officially started working with Loes voor Dieren
                and fostering cats. Piccolo was from the first nest of cats. Her story
                starts really sad, as a baby she was found in the street being
                comatose. The chances of her surviving were slim. It took long time
                for her to recover, of course she did survive, but her growth was
                affected by it. She was named Picollo due to her being extremely
                small. Even now, being 5 years old, she still looks like a little
                baby. Picollo needs a lot of care and attention, as she have also
                suffered brain damage. But that does not make her any worse pet to
                have! Once she gets used to human, she becomes really cuddly. When she
                is laying in her spot and sees you coming, she instantly jumps from
                happiness and waits for her deserved pets.

                Sisco was found on the street, together with his mother and two other
                siblings. His brother died shortly after, but sister Lola has
                survived. He was very, very sick and had an eye infection. For a very
                long it was unknown if Sisco was even able to see anything. During one
                of the check ups at the vet it was decided that it is best to remove
                his eyes, as there were inflammation that could have not been treated.
                After the surgery, he quickly got used to the surroundings. Taking
                care of blind cat took a lot of time, as he had to be trained to
                follow various instructions. Sisco`s story may sound sad, but now he
                is a very happy and very active cat. He knows everything in the house,
                he can still bravely climbs on tall scratching posts, takes care of
                little kittens and plays with his sister Lola.

                Lola is the sister of Sisco. Luckily for her, she was not as sick and
                the eye infection affected only one eye. You might have read a lot
                that animals don`t have a sense of family, but the case of these two
                sibling cats could prove it wrong. If Sisco is in distress, Lola is
                the first one to run to him, she always takes care of him and if
                needed does everything to calm him down. Every evening they play
                together. They share a very deep bond and they could never be
                separated. Lola, being typical female, is very jealous! Even towards
                the little kittens. Over time her jealousy does calm down and she
                starts developing motherly feelings towards little kittens. Lola is
                also very close with her boyfriend Banjer. They are the cutest couple
                in the house, every time they sleep together, you see the little paws
                of Banjer hugging Lola.

                Donut comes from a family of five kittens. Three of five kittens,
                including Donut were really sick. They used to get special drops into
                their eyes a few times a day. This made Donut dislike being petted on
                his head. He can be a very sweet cat, but not many people want a cat
                that does not want to be petted. Of course over time (very long time)
                he forms a trust with humans and does not mind being petted but he
                still prefers to be by himself. Now Donut looks like a traditional
                Dutch donut, better known as oliebollen. As we have so many cats in
                the house, placing him on needed diet is not really possible. We are
                hoping that one day he will find a loving family, who can give him all
                the love he truly deserves.

                Butler was found when he was only one week old and all alone. At his
                back paw he is missing a toe. This might suggest that he was taken
                away from a cat nest by another animal. He was bottle fed. He was the
                first kitten that Vaida (creator of this web page) has bottle fed!
                Butler was always been very sweet and friendly cat. Every time he saw
                humans, he started to purr and ask for attention. Eventually, Butler
                was adopted by Vaida and now he is one of the most spoiled cats in the
                house (or maybe even the world). He loves to knead blankets and
                bathrobes, steal and hide various candies and watch birds on the TV.

                Abbey was found in a big family of cats with no people around. She was
                very malnourished, scared of people. Even though Abbey now for 2 years
                lives in our house, she is still afraid of people. Some cats if found
                too late already are feral and cannot form a bond with humans.
                Sometimes you can pet her and she does enjoy it! But being too afraid
                quickly runs away. We would love to find her a loving new home, but
                she is still not ready to be placed. Every time we get a new litter of
                small kittens, she by observing them is learning more and more about
                people. That gives us hope that one day she could learn how to trust
                humans.

                Freekje is named in honor of Ellen's life partner Freek. Freekje was
                found on Frederik van Eeden street just three days before Freek's
                death. He was found with two sisters, soaking wet in the rain. At that
                time they were only one day old! On their bellies the umbilical cord
                was still attached, letting us know that someone threw them away right
                after birth. All 3 kittens were bottle fed and were growing up really
                quickly! The two sisters after sterilisation were adopted and went to
                live in their new homes. And Freekje, due to sentimental values is
                staying with us. He is a very playful and happy kitten. Currently, he
                is taking very good care of our five little kittens! He is teaching
                them how to play, he is washing them (as they are still too little to
                do it by themselves) and protecting them from other cats.
